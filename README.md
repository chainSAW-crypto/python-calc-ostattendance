# Scientific Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple Scientific Calculator implemented in Python using the Tkinter GUI library. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with common scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, and square root calculations.

## Features
- Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Scientific functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Logarithm (log, ln), Square root
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This program uses the built-in `tkinter` and `math` modules, so no additional installations are required.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python scientific_calculator.py
   ```
3. Use the calculator by clicking the buttons or entering values.

## How It Works
- The calculator displays input in an entry box.
- Clicking `=` evaluates the mathematical expression entered.
- The `C` button clears the entry box.
- Scientific operations are applied to the current input value.
